# esx_T-Caster_advancedgarage
This is an edited version from [esx_advanced garage](https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_advancedgarage), the difference is that here if you store a vehicle in a particular garage you won't be able to take it from any garage but the one that it is in (so this is more realistic).


## Please note
this is the first version of this resource by me, and I haven't fixed the bugs yet, as well as I'm a beginner with this kind of things so please bear with it.
